  <h1>Pahlo Correaâ€™s Website Proposal for CMST386</h1>
    <h2>Client and Topic:</h2>
      <p>I will be building a website to be a building point for my photography company website.</p>
    <h2>Development Process and Engagement:</h2>
      <p>I am making this site for myself, so I will have to do more layout design to start with rather that build parts first and expand.  When I review, I need to kind of stand back and look at it from a 3rd person view.</p>
    <h2>Testing:</h2>
      <p>I will perform function tests on every link and button to insure everything works before launch.</p>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>My business is a Landscape, Portrait, and Travel Photography Business.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the site is to showcase my work, to offer custom services and also maintain some basic photography information on the site.</p>
      <p>Fine art collectors and people that require portrait work in the geographical region.</p>
      <p>This will create a need for easy to view arrangement of work and navigation.</p>
      <p>Will use small photos that link to larger, higher resolution photos.</p>
      <p>Most content will be originally produced from me, but I will have to keep in mind a possible storefront link to be installed at a later date.</p>
      <p>Content should be updated around every two weeks, at least on the main page.</p>
    <h2>Growth Potential and Maintenance:</h2>
      <p>I hope that this site will continue to grow and evolve over time, as I do my work and viewers.</p>
      <p>I hope to make in with minimal maintenance as far as code goes.  But adding photos and changing arrangements are inevitable.</p>
      <p>I am assuming weekly function checks and host site maintenance possibilities.</p>
      <p>It would involved a systematic walk through of every function on the site.</p>
    <h2>Organization:</h2>
      <p>I will organize my content into four main parts:  Mainpage(content links); Information pages; Gallery; contact information/requests.</p>
      <p>The sub-topics are Basic Photographic Information, Photo Gallery, and Contact Options.</p>
    <h2>Web Hosting:</h2>
      <p>I will be starting out with a website only host, and will add store front requirements later when it has been running for a while.  I might end up hosting it from my company server.</p>
      <p>SSL for clients to view work that will not be public, possible shopping cart when I open up to online sales, and statistical information gathering for marketing research.</p>
      <p>I will be writing in HTML5, CCS3, and possibly java, so need support for those languages.</p>
      <p>I already have a domain name at this time: koheia.com</p>
